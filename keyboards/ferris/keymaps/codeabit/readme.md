@codeabit's personal keymap for the Ferris keyboard
====================================================

This keymap was initially inspired by the bruun-baer keymap.

Layer 0 - Letters
Layer 1 - Numbers / Symbols
Layer 2 - Navigation
Layer 3 - Function
Layer 4 - Mouse

The Shift, Control, Alt, and OS keys are home row mods on both the 
left and the right side to facilitate shortcuts.

Layer 2 has tap dance on the 3 key for easy access to dot

Both keyboard halves have a combo with the four corner keys to enter boot mode for flashing.
